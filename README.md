* ⚡ **ECE undergrad** who can’t resist digging into bare-metal.
* 🔧 *Tinker-first* philosophy: if it isn’t broken, mod it anyway.
* 🤝 I share every fail & fix so the next engineer Googling at 3 a.m. finds hope.
* 💬 *“Vibe coding”* advocate — kindness + code > ego + code.
* 📚 **Currently learning** AI engineering, JavaScript, AWS, and PyTorch... it's a lot to take in, but exciting!
